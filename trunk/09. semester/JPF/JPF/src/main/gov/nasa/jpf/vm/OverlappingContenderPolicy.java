/**
 * a thread tracking policy that uses ThreadInfoSets which are search global from
 * the point of object creation. Each object allocation gets a new ThreadInfo set
 * which initially contains only the allocating thread. 
 * 
 * Note that without additional transition breaks this can miss races due 
 * to non-overlapping thread execution along all paths. Most real world systems
 * have enough scheduling points (sync, field access within loops etc.) to avoid this,
 * but short living threads that only have single field access interaction points can
 * run into this effect: T1 creates O, starts T2, accesses O and
 * terminates before T2 runs. When T2 runs, it only sees access to O from an already
 * terminated thread and therefore treats this as a clean handover. Even if
 * T2 would break at its O access, there is no CG that would bring T1 back
 * into a state between creation and access of O, hence races caused by the O access
 * of T1 are missed (see .test.mc.threads.MissedPathTest).
 * Two additional scheduling points help to prevent this case: thread start CGs and
 * object exposure CGs (/after/ assignment in reference field PUTs where the owning
 * object is shared, but the referenced object isn't yet). Both are conservative by
 * nature, i.e. might introduce superfluous states for the sake of not missing paths to 
 * race points. Both can be controlled by configuration options ('cg.threads.break_start'
 * and 'vm.por.break_on_exposure').
 * 
 * Note also that shared-ness is not the same along all paths, because our goal
 * is just to find potential data races. As long as JPF explores /one/ path that
 * leads into a race we are fine - we don't care how many paths don't detect a race.
