/**
 * abstraction for configured policy object that is responsible for detecting shared objects and classes
 * The interface has to support both
 * <ul>
 *   <li> tracking (actual access) based policies
 *        ("what <em>is</em> shared")</li>
 *   <li> conservative reachability based policies
 *        ("what <em>could be</em> shared")</li>
 * </ul> 
 * 
 * The interface is intentionally kept generic to support both policies since tracking - while being
 * far more efficient in terms of states and speed - can either miss some paths or cause state spaces
 * to depend on search history, thus leading to different search graphs for randomized searches.
 * Missed paths only happen in cases where there is very little interaction between threads and
 * defects only happen along single paths. The second case is mostly of interest for comparative
 * studies and not very relevant for bug finding
